["Thou shalt not see thy brother's ox or his sheep driven away, \nand hide thyself from them; thou shalt surely bring them back unto thy \nbrother.\n","And if thy brother be not nigh unto thee, and thou know him \nnot, then thou shalt bring it home to thy house, and it shall be with \nthee until thy brother require it, and thou shalt restore it to him.\n","And so shalt thou do with his ass; and so shalt thou do with \nhis garment; and so shalt thou do with every lost thing of thy \nbrother's, which he hath lost, and thou hast found; thou mayest not hide\n thyself. {S}\n","Thou shalt not see thy brother's ass or his ox fallen down by \nthe way, and hide thyself from them; thou shalt surely help him to lift \nthem up again. {S}\n","A woman shall not wear that which pertaineth unto a man, \nneither shall a man put on a woman's garment; for whosoever doeth these \nthings is an abomination unto the LORD thy God. {P}\n","If a bird's nest chance to be before thee in the way, in any \ntree or on the ground, with young ones or eggs, and the dam sitting upon\n the young, or upon the eggs, thou shalt not take the dam with the \nyoung;\n","thou shalt in any wise let the dam go, but the young thou \nmayest take unto thyself; that it may be well with thee, and that thou \nmayest prolong thy days. {S}\n","When thou buildest a new house, then thou shalt make a parapet \nfor thy roof, that thou bring not blood upon thy house, if any man fall \nfrom thence.\n","Thou shalt not sow thy vineyard with two kinds of seed; lest \nthe fulness of the seed which thou hast sown be forfeited together with \nthe increase of the vineyard. {S}\n","Thou shalt not plow with an ox and an ass together.\n","Thou shalt not wear a mingled stuff, wool and linen together. {S}\n","Thou shalt make thee twisted cords upon the four corners of thy covering, wherewith thou coverest thyself. {S}\n","If any man take a wife, and go in unto her, and hate her,\n","and lay wanton charges against her, and bring up an evil name \nupon her, and say: 'I took this woman, and when I came nigh to her, I \nfound not in her the tokens of virginity';\n","then shall the father of the damsel, and her mother, take and \nbring forth the tokens of the damsel's virginity unto the elders of the \ncity in the gate.\n","And the damsel's father shall say unto the elders: 'I gave my daughter unto this man to wife, and he hateth her;\n","and, lo, he hath laid wanton charges, saying: I found not in \nthy daughter the tokens of virginity; and yet these are the tokens of my\n daughter's virginity.' And they shall spread the garment before the \nelders of the city.\n","And the elders of that city shall take the man and chastise him.\n","And they shall fine him a hundred shekels of silver, and give \nthem unto the father of the damsel, because he hath brought up an evil \nname upon a virgin of Israel; and she shall be his wife; he may not put \nher away all his days. {S}\n","But if this thing be true, that the tokens of virginity were not found in the damsel;\n","then they shall bring out the damsel to the door of her \nfather's house, and the men of her city shall stone her with stones that\n she die; because she hath wrought a wanton deed in Israel, to play the \nharlot in her father's house; so shalt thou put away the evil from the \nmidst of thee. {S}\n","If a man be found lying with a woman married to a husband, \nthen they shall both of them die, the man that lay with the woman, and \nthe woman; so shalt thou put away the evil from Israel. {S}\n","If there be a damsel that is a virgin betrothed unto a man, and a man find her in the city, and lie with her;\n","then ye shall bring them both out unto the gate of that city, \nand ye shall stone them with stones that they die: the damsel, because \nshe cried not, being in the city; and the man, because he hath humbled \nhis neighbour's wife; so thou shalt put away the evil from the midst of \nthee. {S}\n","But if the man find the damsel that is betrothed in the field,\n and the man take hold of her, and lie with her; then the man only that \nlay with her shall die.\n","But unto the damsel thou shalt do nothing; there is in the \ndamsel no sin worthy of death; for as when a man riseth against his \nneighbour, and slayeth him, even so is this matter.\n","For he found her in the field; the betrothed damsel cried, and there was none to save her. {S}\n","If a man find a damsel that is a virgin, that is not betrothed, and lay hold on her, and lie with her, and they be found;\n","then the man that lay with her shall give unto the damsel's \nfather fifty shekels of silver, and she shall be his wife, because he \nhath humbled her; he may not put her away all his days. {S}\n"]
