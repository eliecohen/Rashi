["A man shall not take his father's wife, and shall not uncover his father's skirt. {S}\n","He that is crushed or maimed in his privy parts shall not enter into the assembly of the LORD. {S}\n","A bastard shall not enter into the assembly of the LORD; even \nto the tenth generation shall none of his enter into the assembly of the\n LORD. {S}\n","An Ammonite or a Moabite shall not enter into the assembly of \nthe LORD; even to the tenth generation shall none of them enter into the\n assembly of the LORD for ever;\n","because they met you not with bread and with water in the way, \nwhen ye came forth out of Egypt; and because they hired against thee \nBalaam the son of Beor from Pethor of Aram-naharaim, to curse thee.\n","Nevertheless the LORD thy God would not hearken unto Balaam; \nbut the LORD thy God turned the curse into a blessing unto thee, because\n the LORD thy God loved thee.\n","Thou shalt not seek their peace nor their prosperity all thy days for ever. {S}\n","Thou shalt not abhor an Edomite, for he is thy brother; thou \nshalt not abhor an Egyptian, because thou wast a stranger in his land.\n","The children of the third generation that are born unto them may enter into the assembly of the LORD. {S}\n","When thou goest forth in camp against thine enemies, then thou shalt keep thee from every evil thing.\n","If there be among you any man, that is not clean by reason of \nthat which chanceth him by night, then shall he go abroad out of the \ncamp, he shall not come within the camp.\n","But it shall be, when evening cometh on, he shall bathe \nhimself in water; and when the sun is down, he may come within the camp.\n","Thou shalt have a place also without the camp, whither thou shalt go forth abroad.\n","And thou shalt have a paddle among thy weapons; and it shall \nbe, when thou sittest down abroad, thou shalt dig therewith, and shalt \nturn back and cover that which cometh from thee.\n","For the LORD thy God walketh in the midst of thy camp, to \ndeliver thee, and to give up thine enemies before thee; therefore shall \nthy camp be holy; that He see no unseemly thing in thee, and turn away \nfrom thee. {S}\n","Thou shalt not deliver unto his master a bondman that is escaped from his master unto thee;\n","he shall dwell with thee, in the midst of thee, in the place \nwhich he shall choose within one of thy gates, where it liketh him best;\n thou shalt not wrong him. {S}\n","There shall be no harlot of the daughters of Israel, neither shall there be a sodomite of the sons of Israel.\n","Thou shalt not bring the hire of a harlot, or the price of a \ndog, into the house of the LORD thy God for any vow; for even both these\n are an abomination unto the LORD thy God. {S}\n","Thou shalt not lend upon interest to thy brother: interest of \nmoney, interest of victuals, interest of any thing that is lent upon \ninterest.\n","Unto a foreigner thou mayest lend upon interest; but unto thy \nbrother thou shalt not lend upon interest; that the LORD thy God may \nbless thee in all that thou puttest thy hand unto, in the land whither \nthou goest in to possess it. {S}\n","When thou shalt vow a vow unto the LORD thy God, thou shalt \nnot be slack to pay it; for the LORD thy God will surely require it of \nthee; and it will be sin in thee.\n","But if thou shalt forbear to vow, it shall be no sin in thee.\n","That which is gone out of thy lips thou shalt observe and do; \naccording as thou hast vowed freely unto the LORD thy God, even that \nwhich thou hast promised with thy mouth. {S}\n","When thou comest into thy neighbour's vineyard, then thou \nmayest eat grapes until thou have enough at thine own pleasure; but thou\n shalt not put any in thy vessel. {S}\n","When thou comest into thy neighbour's standing corn, then thou\n mayest pluck ears with thy hand; but thou shalt not move a sickle unto \nthy neighbour's standing corn. {S}\n"]
