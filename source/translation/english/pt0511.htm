["Therefore thou shalt love the LORD thy God, and keep His \ncharge, and His statutes, and His ordinances, and His commandments, \nalway.\n","And know ye this day; for I speak not with your children that \nhave not known, and that have not seen the chastisement of the LORD your\n God, His greatness, His mighty hand, and His outstretched arm,\n","and His signs, and His works, which He did in the midst of Egypt unto Pharaoh the king of Egypt, and unto all his land;\n","and what He did unto the army of Egypt, unto their horses, and \nto their chariots; how He made the water of the Red Sea to overflow them\n as they pursued after you, and how the LORD hath destroyed them unto \nthis day;\n","and what He did unto you in the wilderness, until ye came unto this place;\n","and what He did unto Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, the \nson of Reuben; how the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up, \nand their households, and their tents, and every living substance that \nfollowed them, in the midst of all Israel;\n","but your eyes have seen all the great work of the LORD which He did.\n","Therefore shall ye keep all the commandment which I command \nthee this day, that ye may be strong, and go in and possess the land, \nwhither ye go over to possess it;\n","and that ye may prolong your days upon the land, which the LORD\n swore unto your fathers to give unto them and to their seed, a land \nflowing with milk and honey. {S}\n","For the land, whither thou goest in to possess it, is not as \nthe land of Egypt, from whence ye came out, where thou didst sow thy \nseed, and didst water it with thy foot, as a garden of herbs;\n","but the land, whither ye go over to possess it, is a land of \nhills and valleys, and drinketh water as the rain of heaven cometh down;\n","a land which the LORD thy God careth for; the eyes of the LORD\n thy God are always upon it, from the beginning of the year even unto \nthe end of the year. {S}\n","And it shall come to pass, if ye shall hearken diligently unto\n My commandments which I command you this day, to love the LORD your \nGod, and to serve Him with all your heart and with all your soul,\n","that I will give the rain of your land in its season, the \nformer rain and the latter rain, that thou mayest gather in thy corn, \nand thy wine, and thine oil.\n","And I will give grass in thy fields for thy cattle, and thou shalt eat and be satisfied.\n","Take heed to yourselves, lest your heart be deceived, and ye turn aside, and serve other gods, and worship them;\n","and the anger of the LORD be kindled against you, and He shut \nup the heaven, so that there shall be no rain, and the ground shall not \nyield her fruit; and ye perish quickly from off the good land which the \nLORD giveth you.\n","Therefore shall ye lay up these My words in your heart and in \nyour soul; and ye shall bind them for a sign upon your hand, and they \nshall be for frontlets between your eyes.\n","And ye shall teach them your children, talking of them, when \nthou sittest in thy house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when \nthou liest down, and when thou risest up.\n","And thou shalt write them upon the door-posts of thy house, and upon thy gates;\n","that your days may be multiplied, and the days of your \nchildren, upon the land which the LORD swore unto your fathers to give \nthem, as the days of the heavens above the earth. {S}\n","For if ye shall diligently keep all this commandment which I \ncommand you, to do it, to love the LORD your God, to walk in all His \nways, and to cleave unto Him,\n","then will the LORD drive out all these nations from before \nyou, and ye shall dispossess nations greater and mightier than \nyourselves.\n","Every place whereon the sole of your foot shall tread shall be\n yours: from the wilderness, and Lebanon, from the river, the river \nEuphrates, even unto the hinder sea shall be your border.\n","There shall no man be able to stand against you: the LORD your\n God shall lay the fear of you and the dread of you upon all the land \nthat ye shall tread upon, as He hath spoken unto you. {S}\n","Behold, I set before you this day a blessing and a curse:\n","the blessing, if ye shall hearken unto the commandments of the LORD your God, which I command you this day;\n","and the curse, if ye shall not hearken unto the commandments \nof the LORD your God, but turn aside out of the way which I command you \nthis day, to go after other gods, which ye have not known. {S}\n","And it shall come to pass, when the LORD thy God shall bring \nthee into the land whither thou goest to possess it, that thou shalt set\n the blessing upon mount Gerizim, and the curse upon mount Ebal.\n","Are they not beyond the Jordan, behind the way of the going \ndown of the sun, in the land of the Canaanites that dwell in the Arabah,\n over against Gilgal, beside the terebinths of Moreh?\n","For ye are to pass over the Jordan to go in to possess the \nland which the LORD your God giveth you, and ye shall possess it, and \ndwell therein.\n","And ye shall observe to do all the statutes and the ordinances which I set before you this day.\n"]
