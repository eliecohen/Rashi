["And it shall be, when thou art come in unto the land which the \nLORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance, and dost possess it, and \ndwell therein;\n","that thou shalt take of the first of all the fruit of the \nground, which thou shalt bring in from thy land that the LORD thy God \ngiveth thee; and thou shalt put it in a basket and shalt go unto the \nplace which the LORD thy God shall choose to cause His name to dwell \nthere.\n","And thou shalt come unto the priest that shall be in those \ndays, and say unto him: 'I profess this day unto the LORD thy God, that I\n am come unto the land which the LORD swore unto our fathers to give \nus.'\n","And the priest shall take the basket out of thy hand, and set it down before the altar of the LORD thy God.\n","And thou shalt speak and say before the LORD thy God: 'A \nwandering Aramean was my father, and he went down into Egypt, and \nsojourned there, few in number; and he became there a nation, great, \nmighty, and populous.\n","And the Egyptians dealt ill with us, and afflicted us, and laid upon us hard bondage.\n","And we cried unto the LORD, the God of our fathers, and the \nLORD heard our voice, and saw our affliction, and our toil, and our \noppression.\n","And the LORD brought us forth out of Egypt with a mighty hand, \nand with an outstretched arm, and with great terribleness, and with \nsigns, and with wonders.\n","And He hath brought us into this place, and hath given us this land, a land flowing with milk and honey.\n","And now, behold, I have brought the first of the fruit of the \nland, which Thou, O LORD, hast given me.' And thou shalt set it down \nbefore the LORD thy God, and worship before the LORD thy God.\n","And thou shalt rejoice in all the good which the LORD thy God \nhath given unto thee, and unto thy house, thou, and the Levite, and the \nstranger that is in the midst of thee. {S}\n","When thou hast made an end of tithing all the tithe of thine \nincrease in the third year, which is the year of tithing, and hast given\n it unto the Levite, to the stranger, to the fatherless, and to the \nwidow, that they may eat within thy gates, and be satisfied,\n","then thou shalt say before the LORD thy God: 'I have put away \nthe hallowed things out of my house, and also have given them unto the \nLevite, and unto the stranger, to the fatherless, and to the widow, \naccording to all Thy commandment which Thou hast commanded me; I have \nnot transgressed any of Thy commandments, neither have I forgotten them.\n","I have not eaten thereof in my mourning, neither have I put \naway thereof, being unclean, nor given thereof for the dead; I have \nhearkened to the voice of the LORD my God, I have done according to all \nthat Thou hast commanded me.\n","Look forth from Thy holy habitation, from heaven, and bless \nThy people Israel, and the land which Thou hast given us, as Thou didst \nswear unto our fathers, a land flowing with milk and honey.' {S}\n","This day the LORD thy God commandeth thee to do these statutes\n and ordinances; thou shalt therefore observe and do them with all thy \nheart, and with all thy soul.\n","Thou hast avouched the LORD this day to be thy God, and that \nthou wouldest walk in His ways, and keep His statutes, and His \ncommandments, and His ordinances, and hearken unto His voice.\n","And the LORD hath avouched thee this day to be His own \ntreasure, as He hath promised thee, and that thou shouldest keep all His\n commandments;\n","and to make thee high above all nations that He hath made, in \npraise, and in name, and in glory; and that thou mayest be a holy people\n unto the LORD thy God, as He hath spoken. {P}\n"]
