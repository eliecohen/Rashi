["And when Balaam saw that it pleased the LORD to bless Israel, \nhe went not, as at the other times, to meet with enchantments, but he \nset his face toward the wilderness.\n","And Balaam lifted up his eyes, and he saw Israel dwelling tribe by tribe; and the spirit of God came upon him.\n","And he took up his parable, and said: The saying of Balaam the son of Beor, and the saying of the man whose eye is opened;\n","The saying of him who heareth the words of God, who seeth the vision of the Almighty, fallen down, yet with opened eyes:\n","How goodly are thy tents, O Jacob, thy dwellings, O Israel!\n","As valleys stretched out, as gardens by the river-side; as aloes planted of the LORD, as cedars beside the waters;\n","Water shall flow from his branches, and his seed shall be in \nmany waters; and his king shall be higher than Agag, and his kingdom \nshall be exalted.\n","God who brought him forth out of Egypt is for him like the \nlofty horns of the wild-ox; he shall eat up the nations that are his \nadversaries, and shall break their bones in pieces, and pierce them \nthrough with his arrows.\n","He couched, he lay down as a lion, and as a lioness; who shall \nrouse him up? Blessed be every one that blesseth thee, and cursed be \nevery one that curseth thee.\n","And Balak's anger was kindled against Balaam, and he smote his\n hands together; and Balak said unto Balaam: 'I called thee to curse \nmine enemies, and, behold, thou hast altogether blessed them these three\n times.\n","Therefore now flee thou to thy place; I thought to promote \nthee unto great honour; but, lo, the LORD hath kept thee back from \nhonour.'\n","And Balaam said unto Balak: 'Spoke I not also to thy messengers that thou didst send unto me, saying:\n","If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I \ncannot go beyond the word of the LORD, to do either good or bad of mine \nown mind; what the LORD speaketh, that will I speak?\n","And now, behold, I go unto my people; come, and I will \nannounce to thee what this people shall do to thy people in the end of \ndays.'\n","And he took up his parable, and said: The saying of Balaam the son of Beor, and the saying of the man whose eye is opened;\n","The saying of him who heareth the words of God, and knoweth \nthe knowledge of the Most High, who seeth the vision of the Almighty, \nfallen down, yet with opened eyes:\n","I see him, but not now; I behold him, but not nigh; there \nshall step forth a star out of Jacob, and a scepter shall rise out of \nIsrael, and shall smite through the corners of Moab, and break down all \nthe sons of Seth.\n","And Edom shall be a possession, Seir also, even his enemies, shall be a possession; while Israel doeth valiantly.\n","And out of Jacob shall one have dominion, and shall destroy the remnant from the city.\n","And he looked on Amalek, and took up his parable, and said: \nAmalek was the first of the nations; but his end shall come to \ndestruction.\n","And he looked on the Kenite, and took up his parable, and \nsaid: Though firm be thy dwelling-place, and though thy nest be set in \nthe rock;\n","Nevertheless Kain shall be wasted; How long? Asshur shall carry thee away captive.\n","And he took up his parable, and said: Alas, who shall live after God hath appointed him?\n","But ships shall come from the coast of Kittim, and they shall \nafflict Asshur, and shall afflict Eber, and he also shall come to \ndestruction.\n","And Balaam rose up, and went and returned to his place; and Balak also went his way. {P}\n"]
