["And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying:\n","Command the children of Israel, and say unto them: My food \nwhich is presented unto Me for offerings made by fire, of a sweet savour\n unto Me, shall ye observe to offer unto Me in its due season.\n","And thou shalt say unto them: This is the offering made by fire\n which ye shall bring unto the LORD: he-lambs of the first year without \nblemish, two day by day, for a continual burnt-offering.\n","The one lamb shalt thou offer in the morning, and the other lamb shalt thou offer at dusk;\n","and the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a meal-offering, mingled with the fourth part of a hin of beaten oil.\n","It is a continual burnt-offering, which was offered in mount Sinai, for a sweet savour, an offering made by fire unto the LORD.\n","And the drink-offering thereof shall be the fourth part of a \nhin for the one lamb; in the holy place shalt thou pour out a \ndrink-offering of strong drink unto the LORD.\n","And the other lamb shalt thou present at dusk; as the \nmeal-offering of the morning, and as the drink-offering thereof, thou \nshalt present it, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the \nLORD. {P}\n","And on the sabbath day two he-lambs of the first year without \nblemish, and two tenth parts of an ephah of fine flour for a \nmeal-offering, mingled with oil, and the drink-offering thereof.\n","This is the burnt-offering of every sabbath, beside the continual burnt-offering, and the drink-offering thereof. {P}\n","And in your new moons ye shall present a burnt-offering unto \nthe LORD: two young bullocks, and one ram, seven he-lambs of the first \nyear without blemish;\n","and three tenth parts of an ephah of fine flour for a \nmeal-offering, mingled with oil, for each bullock; and two tenth parts \nof fine flour for a meal-offering, mingled with oil, for the one ram;\n","and a several tenth part of fine flour mingled with oil for a \nmeal-offering unto every lamb; for a burnt-offering of a sweet savour, \nan offering made by fire unto the LORD.\n","And their drink-offerings shall be half a hin of wine for a \nbullock, and the third part of a hin for the ram, and the fourth part of\n a hin for a lamb. This is the burnt-offering of every new moon \nthroughout the months of the year.\n","And one he-goat for a sin-offering unto the LORD; it shall be \noffered beside the continual burnt-offering, and the drink-offering \nthereof. {S}\n","And in the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month, is the LORD'S passover.\n","And on the fifteenth day of this month shall be a feast; seven days shall unleavened bread be eaten.\n","In the first day shall be a holy convocation; ye shall do no manner of servile work;\n","but ye shall present an offering made by fire, a \nburnt-offering unto the LORD: two young bullocks, and one ram, and seven\n he-lambs of the first year; they shall be unto you without blemish;\n","and their meal-offering, fine flour mingled with oil; three \ntenth parts shall ye offer for a bullock, and two tenth parts for the \nram;\n","a several tenth part shalt thou offer for every lamb of the seven lambs;\n","and one he-goat for a sin-offering, to make atonement for you.\n","Ye shall offer these beside the burnt-offering of the morning, which is for a continual burnt-offering.\n","After this manner ye shall offer daily, for seven days, the \nfood of the offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD; it \nshall be offered beside the continual burnt-offering, and the \ndrink-offering thereof.\n","And on the seventh day ye shall have a holy convocation; ye shall do no manner of servile work. {S}\n","Also in the day of the first-fruits, when ye bring a new \nmeal-offering unto the LORD in your feast of weeks, ye shall have a holy\n convocation: ye shall do no manner of servile work;\n","but ye shall present a burnt-offering for a sweet savour unto \nthe LORD: two young bullocks, one ram, seven he-lambs of the first year;\n","and their meal-offering, fine flour mingled with oil, three tenth parts for each bullock, two tenth parts for the one ram,\n","a several tenth part for every lamb of the seven lambs;\n","one he-goat, to make atonement for you.\n","Beside the continual burnt-offering, and the meal-offering \nthereof, ye shall offer them--they shall be unto you without \nblemish--and their drink-offerings. {P}\n"]
