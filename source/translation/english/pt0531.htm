["And Moses went and spoke these words unto all Israel.\n","And he said unto them: 'I am a hundred and twenty years old \nthis day; I can no more go out and come in; and the LORD hath said unto \nme: Thou shalt not go over this Jordan.\n","The LORD thy God, He will go over before thee; He will destroy \nthese nations from before thee, and thou shalt dispossess them; and \nJoshua, he shall go over before thee, as the LORD hath spoken.\n","And the LORD will do unto them as He did to Sihon and to Og, the kings of the Amorites, and unto their land; whom He destroyed.\n","And the LORD will deliver them up before you, and ye shall do \nunto them according unto all the commandment which I have commanded you.\n","Be strong and of good courage, fear not, nor be affrighted at \nthem; for the LORD thy God, He it is that doth go with thee; He will not\n fail thee, nor forsake thee.' {S}\n","And Moses called unto Joshua, and said unto him in the sight of\n all Israel: 'Be strong and of good courage; for thou shalt go with this\n people into the land which the LORD hath sworn unto their fathers to \ngive them; and thou shalt cause them to inherit it.\n","And the LORD, He it is that doth go before thee; He will be \nwith thee, He will not fail thee, neither forsake thee; fear not, \nneither be dismayed.'\n","And Moses wrote this law, and delivered it unto the priests the\n sons of Levi, that bore the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and unto \nall the elders of Israel.\n","And Moses commanded them, saying: 'At the end of every seven \nyears, in the set time of the year of release, in the feast of \ntabernacles,\n","when all Israel is come to appear before the LORD thy God in \nthe place which He shall choose, thou shalt read this law before all \nIsrael in their hearing.\n","Assemble the people, the men and the women and the little \nones, and thy stranger that is within thy gates, that they may hear, and\n that they may learn, and fear the LORD your God, and observe to do all \nthe words of this law;\n","and that their children, who have not known, may hear, and \nlearn to fear the LORD your God, as long as ye live in the land whither \nye go over the Jordan to possess it.' {P}\n","And the LORD said unto Moses: 'Behold, thy days approach that \nthou must die; call Joshua, and present yourselves in the tent of \nmeeting, that I may give him a charge.' And Moses and Joshua went, and \npresented themselves in the tent of meeting.\n","And the LORD appeared in the Tent in a pillar of cloud; and the pillar of cloud stood over the door of the Tent.\n","And the LORD said unto Moses: 'Behold, thou art about to sleep\n with thy fathers; and this people will rise up, and go astray after the\n foreign gods of the land, whither they go to be among them, and will \nforsake Me, and break My covenant which I have made with them.\n","Then My anger shall be kindled against them in that day, and I\n will forsake them, and I will hide My face from them, and they shall be\n devoured, and many evils and troubles shall come upon them; so that \nthey will say in that day: Are not these evils come upon us because our \nGod is not among us?\n","And I will surely hide My face in that day for all the evil \nwhich they shall have wrought, in that they are turned unto other gods.\n","Now therefore write ye this song for you, and teach thou it \nthe children of Israel; put it in their mouths, that this song may be a \nwitness for Me against the children of Israel.\n","For when I shall have brought them into the land which I swore\n unto their fathers, flowing with milk and honey; and they shall have \neaten their fill, and waxen fat; and turned unto other gods, and served \nthem, and despised Me, and broken My covenant;\n","then it shall come to pass, when many evils and troubles are \ncome upon them, that this song shall testify before them as a witness; \nfor it shall not be forgotten out of the mouths of their seed; for I \nknow their imagination how they do even now, before I have brought them \ninto the land which I swore.'\n","So Moses wrote this song the same day, and taught it the children of Israel.\n","And he gave Joshua the son of Nun a charge, and said: 'Be \nstrong and of good courage; for thou shalt bring the children of Israel \ninto the land which I swore unto them; and I will be with thee.'\n","And it came to pass, when Moses had made an end of writing the words of this law in a book, until they were finished,\n","that Moses commanded the Levites, that bore the ark of the covenant of the LORD, saying:\n","'Take this book of the law, and put it by the side of the ark \nof the covenant of the LORD your God, that it may be there for a witness\n against thee.\n","For I know thy rebellion, and thy stiff neck; behold, while I \nam yet alive with you this day, ye have been rebellious against the \nLORD; and how much more after my death?\n","Assemble unto me all the elders of your tribes, and your \nofficers, that I may speak these words in their ears, and call heaven \nand earth to witness against them.\n","For I know that after my death ye will in any wise deal \ncorruptly, and turn aside from the way which I have commanded you; and \nevil will befall you in the end of days; because ye will do that which \nis evil in the sight of the LORD, to provoke Him through the work of \nyour hands.'\n","And Moses spoke in the ears of all the assembly of Israel the words of this song, until they were finished: {P}\n"]
