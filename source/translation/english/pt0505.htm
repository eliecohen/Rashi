["And Moses called unto all Israel, and said unto them: Hear, O \nIsrael, the statutes and the ordinances which I speak in your ears this \nday, that ye may learn them, and observe to do them.\n","The LORD our God made a covenant with us in Horeb.\n","The LORD made not this covenant with our fathers, but with us, even us, who are all of us here alive this day.\n","The LORD spoke with you face to face in the mount out of the midst of the fire--\n","I stood between the LORD and you at that time, to declare unto \nyou the word of the LORD; for ye were afraid because of the fire, and \nwent not up into the mount--saying: {S}\n","I am the LORD thy God, who brought thee out of the land of \nEgypt, out of the house of bondage. Thou shalt have no other gods before\n Me.\n","Thou shalt not make unto thee a graven image, even any manner \nof likeness, of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the \nearth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth.\n","Thou shalt not bow down unto them, nor serve them; for I the \nLORD thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon\n the children, and upon the third and upon the fourth generation of them\n that hate Me,\n","and showing mercy unto the thousandth generation of them that love Me and keep My commandments. {S}\n","Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain; for \nthe LORD will not hold him guiltless that taketh His name in vain. {S}\n","Observe the sabbath day, to keep it holy, as the LORD thy God commanded thee.\n","Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work;\n","but the seventh day is a sabbath unto the LORD thy God, in it \nthou shalt not do any manner of work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy \ndaughter, nor thy man-servant, nor thy maid-servant, nor thine ox, nor \nthine ass, nor any of thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy \ngates; that thy man-servant and thy maid-servant may rest as well as \nthou.\n","And thou shalt remember that thou was a servant in the land of\n Egypt, and the LORD thy God brought thee out thence by a mighty hand \nand by an outstretched arm; therefore the LORD thy God commanded thee to\n keep the sabbath day. {S}\n","Honour thy father and thy mother, as the LORD thy God \ncommanded thee; that thy days may be long, and that it may go well with \nthee, upon the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee. {S}\n","Thou shalt not murder. {S} Neither shalt thou commit adultery. {S} Neither shalt thou steal. {S} Neither shalt thou bear false witness against thy neighbour. {S}\n","Neither shalt thou covet thy neighbour's wife; {S} \nneither shalt thou desire thy neighbour's house, his field, or his \nman-servant, or his maid-servant, his ox, or his ass, or any thing that \nis thy neighbour's. {S}\n","These words the LORD spoke unto all your assembly in the mount\n out of the midst of the fire, of the cloud, and of the thick darkness, \nwith a great voice, and it went on no more. And He wrote them upon two \ntables of stone, and gave them unto me.\n","And it came to pass, when ye heard the voice out of the midst \nof the darkness, while the mountain did burn with fire, that ye came \nnear unto me, even all the heads of your tribes, and your elders;\n","and ye said: 'Behold, the LORD our God hath shown us His glory\n and His greatness, and we have heard His voice out of the midst of the \nfire; we have seen this day that God doth speak with man, and he liveth.\n","Now therefore why should we die? for this great fire will \nconsume us; if we hear the voice of the LORD our God any more, then we \nshall die.\n","For who is there of all flesh, that hath heard the voice of \nthe living God speaking out of the midst of the fire, as we have, and \nlived?\n","Go thou near, and hear all that the LORD our God may say; and \nthou shalt speak unto us all that the LORD our God may speak unto thee; \nand we will hear it and do it.'\n","And the LORD heard the voice of your words, when ye spoke unto\n me; and the LORD said unto me: 'I have heard the voice of the words of \nthis people, which they have spoken unto thee; they have well said all \nthat they have spoken.\n","Oh that they had such a heart as this alway, to fear Me, and \nkeep all My commandments, that it might be well with them, and with \ntheir children for ever!\n","Go say to them: Return ye to your tents.\n","But as for thee, stand thou here by Me, and I will speak unto \nthee all the commandment, and the statutes, and the ordinances, which \nthou shalt teach them, that they may do them in the land which I give \nthem to possess it.'\n","Ye shall observe to do therefore as the LORD your God hath \ncommanded you; ye shall not turn aside to the right hand or to the left.\n","Ye shall walk in all the way which the LORD your God hath \ncommanded you, that ye may live, and that it may be well with you, and \nthat ye may prolong your days in the land which ye shall possess.\n"]
