["And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying:\n","'Speak unto Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, that he take \nup the fire-pans out of the burning, and scatter thou the fire yonder; \nfor they are become holy;\n","even the fire-pans of these men who have sinned at the cost of \ntheir lives, and let them be made beaten plates for a covering of the \naltar--for they are become holy, because they were offered before the \nLORD--that they may be a sign unto the children of Israel.'\n","And Eleazar the priest took the brazen fire-pans, which they \nthat were burnt had offered; and they beat them out for a covering of \nthe altar,\n","to be a memorial unto the children of Israel, to the end that \nno common man, that is not of the seed of Aaron, draw near to burn \nincense before the LORD; that he fare not as Korah, and as his company; \nas the LORD spoke unto him by the hand of Moses. {P}\n","But on the morrow all the congregation of the children of \nIsrael murmured against Moses and against Aaron, saying: 'Ye have killed\n the people of the LORD.'\n","And it came to pass, when the congregation was assembled \nagainst Moses and against Aaron, that they looked toward the tent of \nmeeting; and, behold, the cloud covered it, and the glory of the LORD \nappeared.\n","And Moses and Aaron came to the front of the tent of meeting. {S}\n","And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying:\n","'Get you up from among this congregation, that I may consume them in a moment.' And they fell upon their faces.\n","And Moses said unto Aaron: 'Take thy fire-pan, and put fire \ntherein from off the altar, and lay incense thereon, and carry it \nquickly unto the congregation, and make atonement for them; for there is\n wrath gone out from the LORD: the plague is begun.'\n","And Aaron took as Moses spoke, and ran into the midst of the \nassembly; and, behold, the plague was begun among the people; and he put\n on the incense, and made atonement for the people.\n","And he stood between the dead and the living; and the plague was stayed.\n","Now they that died by the plague were fourteen thousand and seven hundred, besides them that died about the matter of Korah.\n","And Aaron returned unto Moses unto the door of the tent of meeting, and the plague was stayed. {P}\n","And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying:\n","'Speak unto the children of Israel, and take of them rods, one\n for each fathers' house, of all their princes according to their \nfathers' houses, twelve rods; thou shalt write every man's name upon his\n rod.\n","And thou shalt write Aaron's name upon the rod of Levi, for there shall be one rod for the head of their fathers' houses.\n","And thou shalt lay them up in the tent of meeting before the testimony, where I meet with you.\n","And it shall come to pass, that the man whom I shall choose, \nhis rod shall bud; and I will make to cease from Me the murmurings of \nthe children of Israel, which they murmur against you.'\n","And Moses spoke unto the children of Israel; and all their \nprinces gave him rods, for each prince one, according to their fathers' \nhouses, even twelve rods; and the rod of Aaron was among their rods.\n","And Moses laid up the rods before the LORD in the tent of the testimony.\n","And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses went into the \ntent of the testimony; and, behold, the rod of Aaron for the house of \nLevi was budded, and put forth buds, and bloomed blossoms, and bore ripe\n almonds.\n","And Moses brought out all the rods from before the LORD unto \nall the children of Israel; and they looked, and took every man his rod.\n {P}\n","And the LORD said unto Moses: 'Put back the rod of Aaron \nbefore the testimony, to be kept there, for a token against the \nrebellious children; that there may be made an end of their murmurings \nagainst Me, that they die not.'\n","Thus did Moses; as the LORD commanded him, so did he. {P}\n","And the children of Israel spoke unto Moses, saying: 'Behold, we perish, we are undone, we are all undone.\n","Every one that cometh near, that cometh near unto the tabernacle of the LORD, is to die; shall we wholly perish?' {S}\n"]
