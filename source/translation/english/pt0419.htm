["And the LORD spoke unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying:\n","This is the statute of the law which the LORD hath commanded, \nsaying: Speak unto the children of Israel, that they bring thee a red \nheifer, faultless, wherein is no blemish, and upon which never came \nyoke.\n","And ye shall give her unto Eleazar the priest, and she shall be\n brought forth without the camp, and she shall be slain before his face.\n","And Eleazar the priest shall take of her blood with his finger,\n and sprinkle of her blood toward the front of the tent of meeting seven\n times.\n","And the heifer shall be burnt in his sight; her skin, and her flesh, and her blood, with her dung, shall be burnt.\n","And the priest shall take cedar-wood, and hyssop, and scarlet, and cast it into the midst of the burning of the heifer.\n","Then the priest shall wash his clothes, and he shall bathe his \nflesh in water, and afterward he may come into the camp, and the priest \nshall be unclean until the even.\n","And he that burneth her shall wash his clothes in water, and bathe his flesh in water, and shall be unclean until the even.\n","And a man that is clean shall gather up the ashes of the \nheifer, and lay them up without the camp in a clean place, and it shall \nbe kept for the congregation of the children of Israel for a water of \nsprinkling; it is a purification from sin.\n","And he that gathereth the ashes of the heifer shall wash his \nclothes, and be unclean until the even; and it shall be unto the \nchildren of Israel, and unto the stranger that sojourneth among them, \nfor a statute for ever.\n","He that toucheth the dead, even any man's dead body, shall be unclean seven days;\n","the same shall purify himself therewith on the third day and \non the seventh day, and he shall be clean; but if he purify not himself \nthe third day and the seventh day, he shall not be clean.\n","Whosoever toucheth the dead, even the body of any man that is \ndead, and purifieth not himself--he hath defiled the tabernacle of the \nLORD--that soul shall be cut off from Israel; because the water of \nsprinkling was not dashed against him, he shall be unclean; his \nuncleanness is yet upon him.\n","This is the law: when a man dieth in a tent, every one that \ncometh into the tent, and every thing that is in the tent, shall be \nunclean seven days.\n","And every open vessel, which hath no covering close-bound upon it, is unclean.\n","And whosoever in the open field toucheth one that is slain \nwith a sword, or one that dieth of himself, or a bone of a man, or a \ngrave, shall be unclean seven days.\n","And for the unclean they shall take of the ashes of the \nburning of the purification from sin, and running water shall be put \nthereto in a vessel.\n","And a clean person shall take hyssop, and dip it in the water,\n and sprinkle it upon the tent, and upon all the vessels, and upon the \npersons that were there, and upon him that touched the bone, or the \nslain, or the dead, or the grave.\n","And the clean person shall sprinkle upon the unclean on the \nthird day, and on the seventh day; and on the seventh day he shall \npurify him; and he shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, \nand shall be clean at even.\n","But the man that shall be unclean, and shall not purify \nhimself, that soul shall be cut off from the midst of the assembly, \nbecause he hath defiled the sanctuary of the LORD; the water of \nsprinkling hath not been dashed against him: he is unclean.\n","And it shall be a perpetual statute unto them; and he that \nsprinkleth the water of sprinkling shall wash his clothes; and he that \ntoucheth the water of sprinkling shall be unclean until even.\n","And whatsoever the unclean person toucheth shall be unclean; and the soul that toucheth him shall be unclean until even. {P}\n"]
