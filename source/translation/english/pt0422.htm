["And the children of Israel journeyed, and pitched in the plains of Moab beyond the Jordan at Jericho. {S}\n","And Balak the son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the Amorites.\n","And Moab was sore afraid of the people, because they were many;\n and Moab was overcome with dread because of the children of Israel.\n","And Moab said unto the elders of Midian: 'Now will this \nmultitude lick up all that is round about us, as the ox licketh up the \ngrass of the field.'--And Balak the son of Zippor was king of Moab at \nthat time.--\n","And he sent messengers unto Balaam the son of Beor, to Pethor, \nwhich is by the River, to the land of the children of his people, to \ncall him, saying: 'Behold, there is a people come out from Egypt; \nbehold, they cover the face of the earth, and they abide over against \nme.\n","Come now therefore, I pray thee, curse me this people; for they\n are too mighty for me; peradventure I shall prevail, that we may smite \nthem, and that I may drive them out of the land; for I know that he whom\n thou blessest is blessed, and he whom thou cursest is cursed.'\n","And the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with \nthe rewards of divination in their hand; and they came unto Balaam, and \nspoke unto him the words of Balak.\n","And he said unto them: 'Lodge here this night, and I will bring\n you back word, as the LORD may speak unto me'; and the princes of Moab \nabode with Balaam.\n","And God came unto Balaam, and said: 'What men are these with thee?'\n","And Balaam said unto God: 'Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, hath sent unto me [saying]:\n","Behold the people that is come out of Egypt, it covereth the \nface of the earth; now, come curse me them; peradventure I shall be able\n to fight against them, and shall drive them out.'\n","And God said unto Balaam: 'Thou shalt not go with them; thou shalt not curse the people; for they are blessed.'\n","And Balaam rose up in the morning, and said unto the princes \nof Balak: 'Get you into your land; for the LORD refuseth to give me \nleave to go with you.'\n","And the princes of Moab rose up, and they went unto Balak, and said: 'Balaam refuseth to come with us.'\n","And Balak sent yet again princes, more, and more honourable than they.\n","And they came to Balaam, and said to him: 'Thus saith Balak \nthe son of Zippor: Let nothing, I pray thee, hinder thee from coming \nunto me;\n","for I will promote thee unto very great honour, and whatsoever\n thou sayest unto me I will do; come therefore, I pray thee, curse me \nthis people.'\n","And Balaam answered and said unto the servants of Balak: 'If \nBalak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go \nbeyond the word of the LORD my God, to do any thing, small or great.\n","Now therefore, I pray you, tarry ye also here this night, that I may know what the LORD will speak unto me more.'\n","And God came unto Balaam at night, and said unto him: 'If the \nmen are come to call thee, rise up, go with them; but only the word \nwhich I speak unto thee, that shalt thou do.'\n","And Balaam rose up in the morning, and saddled his ass, and went with the princes of Moab.\n","And God's anger was kindled because he went; and the angel of \nthe LORD placed himself in the way for an adversary against him.--Now he\n was riding upon his ass, and his two servants were with him.--\n","And the ass saw the angel of the LORD standing in the way, \nwith his sword drawn in his hand; and the ass turned aside out of the \nway, and went into the field; and Balaam smote the ass, to turn her into\n the way.\n","Then the angel of the LORD stood in a hollow way between the vineyards, a fence being on this side, and a fence on that side.\n","And the ass saw the angel of the LORD, and she thrust herself \nunto the wall, and crushed Balaam's foot against the wall; and he smote \nher again.\n","And the angel of the LORD went further, and stood in a narrow \nplace, where was no way to turn either to the right hand or to the left.\n","And the ass saw the angel of the LORD, and she lay down under \nBalaam; and Balaam's anger was kindled, and he smote the ass with his \nstaff.\n","And the LORD opened the mouth of the ass, and she said unto \nBalaam: 'What have I done unto thee, that thou hast smitten me these \nthree times?'\n","And Balaam said unto the ass: 'Because thou hast mocked me; I would there were a sword in my hand, for now I had killed thee.'\n","And the ass said unto Balaam: 'Am not I thine ass, upon which \nthou hast ridden all thy life long unto this day? was I ever wont to do \nso unto thee?' And he said: 'Nay.'\n","Then the LORD opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the angel \nof the LORD standing in the way, with his sword drawn in his hand; and \nhe bowed his head, and fell on his face.\n","And the angel of the LORD said unto him: 'Wherefore hast thou \nsmitten thine ass these three times? behold, I am come forth for an \nadversary, because thy way is contrary unto me;\n","and the ass saw me, and turned aside before me these three \ntimes; unless she had turned aside from me, surely now I had even slain \nthee, and saved her alive.'\n","And Balaam said unto the angel of the LORD: 'I have sinned; \nfor I knew not that thou stoodest in the way against me; now therefore, \nif it displease thee, I will get me back.'\n","And the angel of the LORD said unto Balaam: 'Go with the men; \nbut only the word that I shall speak unto thee, that thou shalt speak.' \nSo Balaam went with the princes of Balak.\n","And when Balak heard that Balaam was come, he went out to meet\n him unto Ir-moab, which is on the border of Arnon, which is in the \nutmost part of the border.\n","And Balak said unto Balaam: 'Did I not earnestly send unto \nthee to call thee? wherefore camest thou not unto me? am I not able \nindeed to promote thee to honour?'\n","And Balaam said unto Balak: 'Lo, I am come unto thee; have I \nnow any power at all to speak any thing? the word that God putteth in my\n mouth, that shall I speak.'\n","And Balaam went with Balak, and they came unto Kiriath-huzoth.\n","And Balak sacrificed oxen and sheep, and sent to Balaam, and to the princes that were with him.\n","And it came to pass in the morning that Balak took Balaam, and\n brought him up into Bamoth-baal, and he saw from thence the utmost part\n of the people.\n"]
