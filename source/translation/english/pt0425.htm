["And Israel abode in Shittim, and the people began to commit harlotry with the daughters of Moab.\n","And they called the people unto the sacrifices of their gods; and the people did eat, and bowed down to their gods.\n","And Israel joined himself unto the Baal of Peor; and the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel.\n","And the LORD said unto Moses: 'Take all the chiefs of the \npeople, and hang them up unto the LORD in face of the sun, that the \nfierce anger of the LORD may turn away from Israel.'\n","And Moses said unto the judges of Israel: 'Slay ye every one his men that have joined themselves unto the Baal of Peor.'\n","And, behold, one of the children of Israel came and brought \nunto his brethren a Midianitish woman in the sight of Moses, and in the \nsight of all the congregation of the children of Israel, while they were\n weeping at the door of the tent of meeting.\n","And when Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the \npriest, saw it, he rose up from the midst of the congregation, and took a\n spear in his hand.\n","And he went after the man of Israel into the chamber, and \nthrust both of them through, the man of Israel, and the woman through \nher belly. So the plague was stayed from the children of Israel.\n","And those that died by the plague were twenty and four thousand. {P}\n","And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying:\n","'Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, \nhath turned My wrath away from the children of Israel, in that he was \nvery jealous for My sake among them, so that I consumed not the children\n of Israel in My jealousy.\n","Wherefore say: Behold, I give unto him My covenant of peace;\n","and it shall be unto him, and to his seed after him, the \ncovenant of an everlasting priesthood; because he was jealous for his \nGod, and made atonement for the children of Israel.'\n","Now the name of the man of Israel that was slain, who was \nslain with the Midianitish woman, was Zimri, the son of Salu, a prince \nof a fathers' house among the Simeonites.\n","And the name of the Midianitish woman that was slain was \nCozbi, the daughter of Zur; he was head of the people of a fathers' \nhouse in Midian. {P}\n","And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying:\n","'Harass the Midianites, and smite them;\n","for they harass you, by their wiles wherewith they have \nbeguiled you in the matter of Peor, and in the matter of Cozbi, the \ndaughter of the prince of Midian, their sister, who was slain on the day\n of the plague in the matter of Peor.'\n"]
