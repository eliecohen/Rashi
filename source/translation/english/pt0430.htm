["And Moses told the children of Israel according to all that the LORD commanded Moses. {P}\n","And Moses spoke unto the heads of the tribes of the children of\n Israel, saying: This is the thing which the LORD hath commanded.\n","When a man voweth a vow unto the LORD, or sweareth an oath to \nbind his soul with a bond, he shall not break his word; he shall do \naccording to all that proceedeth out of his mouth.\n","Also when a woman voweth a vow unto the LORD, and bindeth herself by a bond, being in her father's house, in her youth,\n","and her father heareth her vow, or her bond wherewith she hath \nbound her soul, and her father holdeth his peace at her, then all her \nvows shall stand, and every bond wherewith she hath bound her soul shall\n stand.\n","But if her father disallow her in the day that he heareth, none\n of her vows, or of her bonds wherewith she hath bound her soul, shall \nstand; and the LORD will forgive her, because her father disallowed her.\n","And if she be married to a husband, while her vows are upon \nher, or the clear utterance of her lips, wherewith she hath bound her \nsoul;\n","and her husband hear it, whatsoever day it be that he heareth \nit, and hold his peace at her; then her vows shall stand, and her bonds \nwherewith she hath bound her soul shall stand.\n","But if her husband disallow her in the day that he heareth it, \nthen he shall make void her vow which is upon her, and the clear \nutterance of her lips, wherewith she hath bound her soul; and the LORD \nwill forgive her.\n","But the vow of a widow, or of her that is divorced, even every\n thing wherewith she hath bound her soul, shall stand against her.\n","And if a woman vowed in her husband's house, or bound her soul by a bond with an oath,\n","and her husband heard it, and held his peace at her, and \ndisallowed her not, then all her vows shall stand, and every bond \nwherewith she bound her soul shall stand.\n","But if her husband make them null and void in the day that he \nheareth them, then whatsoever proceeded out of her lips, whether it were\n her vows, or the bond of her soul, shall not stand: her husband hath \nmade them void; and the LORD will forgive her.\n","Every vow, and every binding oath to afflict the soul, her husband may let it stand, or her husband may make it void.\n","But if her husband altogether hold his peace at her from day \nto day, then he causeth all her vows to stand, or all her bonds, which \nare upon her; he hath let them stand, because he held his peace at her \nin the day that he heard them.\n","But if he shall make them null and void after that he hath heard them, then he shall bear her iniquity.\n","These are the statutes, which the LORD commanded Moses, \nbetween a man and his wife, between a father and his daughter, being in \nher youth, in her father's house. {P}\n"]
