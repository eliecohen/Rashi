["When the LORD thy God shall cut off the nations, whose land the\n LORD thy God giveth thee, and thou dost succeed them, and dwell in \ntheir cities, and in their houses;\n","thou shalt separate three cities for thee in the midst of thy land, which the LORD thy GOD giveth thee to possess it.\n","Thou shalt prepare thee the way, and divide the borders of thy \nland, which the LORD thy God causeth thee to inherit, into three parts, \nthat every manslayer may flee thither.\n","And this is the case of the manslayer, that shall flee thither \nand live: whoso killeth his neighbour unawares, and hated him not in \ntime past;\n","as when a man goeth into the forest with his neighbour to hew \nwood, and his hand fetcheth a stroke with the axe to cut down the tree, \nand the head slippeth from the helve, and lighteth upon his neighbour, \nthat he die; he shall flee unto one of these cities and live;\n","lest the avenger of blood pursue the manslayer, while his heart\n is hot, and overtake him, because the way is long, and smite him \nmortally; whereas he was not deserving of death, inasmuch as he hated \nhim not in time past.\n","Wherefore I command thee, saying: 'Thou shalt separate three cities for thee.'\n","And if the LORD thy God enlarge thy border, as He hath sworn \nunto thy fathers, and give thee all the land which He promised to give \nunto thy fathers--\n","if thou shalt keep all this commandment to do it, which I \ncommand thee this day, to love the LORD thy God, and to walk ever in His\n ways--then shalt thou add three cities more for thee, beside these \nthree;\n","that innocent blood be not shed in the midst of thy land, \nwhich the LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance, and so blood be \nupon thee. {P}\n","But if any man hate his neighbour, and lie in wait for him, \nand rise up against him, and smite him mortally that he die; and he flee\n into one of these cities;\n","then the elders of his city shall send and fetch him thence, \nand deliver him into the hand of the avenger of blood, that he may die.\n","Thine eye shall not pity him, but thou shalt put away the blood of the innocent from Israel, that it may go well with thee. {S}\n","Thou shalt not remove thy neighbour's landmark, which they of \nold time have set, in thine inheritance which thou shalt inherit, in the\n land that the LORD thy God giveth thee to possess it. {S}\n","One witness shall not rise up against a man for any iniquity, \nor for any sin, in any sin that he sinneth; at the mouth of two \nwitnesses, or at the mouth of three witnesses, shall a matter be \nestablished.\n","If an unrighteous witness rise up against any man to bear perverted witness against him;\n","then both the men, between whom the controversy is, shall \nstand before the LORD, before the priests and the judges that shall be \nin those days.\n","And the judges shall inquire diligently; and, behold, if the \nwitness be a false witness, and hath testified falsely against his \nbrother;\n","then shall ye do unto him, as he had purposed to do unto his brother; so shalt thou put away the evil from the midst of thee.\n","And those that remain shall hear, and fear, and shall henceforth commit no more any such evil in the midst of thee.\n","And thine eye shall not pity: life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot. {S}\n"]
