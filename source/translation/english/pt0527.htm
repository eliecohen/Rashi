["And Moses and the elders of Israel commanded the people, saying: 'Keep all the commandment which I command you this day.\n","And it shall be on the day when ye shall pass over the Jordan \nunto the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee, that thou shalt set \nthee up great stones, and plaster them with plaster.\n","And thou shalt write upon them all the words of this law, when \nthou art passed over; that thou mayest go in unto the land which the \nLORD thy God giveth thee, a land flowing with milk and honey, as the \nLORD, the God of thy fathers, hath promised thee.\n","And it shall be when ye are passed over the Jordan, that ye \nshall set up these stones, which I command you this day, in mount Ebal, \nand thou shalt plaster them with plaster.\n","And there shalt thou build an altar unto the LORD thy God, an altar of stones; thou shalt lift up no iron tool upon them.\n","Thou shalt build the altar of the LORD thy God of unhewn \nstones; and thou shalt offer burnt-offerings thereon unto the LORD thy \nGod.\n","And thou shalt sacrifice peace-offerings, and shalt eat there; and thou shalt rejoice before the LORD thy God.\n","And thou shalt write upon the stones all the words of this law very plainly.' {S}\n","And Moses and the priests the Levites spoke unto all Israel, \nsaying: 'Keep silence, and hear, O Israel; this day thou art become a \npeople unto the LORD thy God.\n","Thou shalt therefore hearken to the voice of the LORD thy God,\n and do His commandments and His statutes, which I command thee this \nday.' {S}\n","And Moses charged the people the same day, saying:\n","'These shall stand upon mount Gerizim to bless the people, \nwhen ye are passed over the Jordan: Simeon, and Levi, and Judah, and \nIssachar, and Joseph, and Benjamin;\n","and these shall stand upon mount Ebal for the curse: Reuben, Gad, and Asher, and Zebulun, Dan, and Naphtali.\n","And the Levites shall speak, and say unto all the men of Israel with a loud voice: {S}\n","Cursed be the man that maketh a graven or molten image, an \nabomination unto the LORD, the work of the hands of the craftsman, and \nsetteth it up in secret. And all the people shall answer and say: Amen. {S}\n","Cursed be he that dishonoureth his father or his mother. And all the people shall say: Amen. {S}\n","Cursed be he that removeth his neighbour's landmark. And all the people shall say: Amen. {S}\n","Cursed be he that maketh the blind to go astray in the way. And all the people shall say: Amen. {S}\n","Cursed be he that perverteth the justice due to the stranger, fatherless, and widow. And all the people shall say: Amen.\n","Cursed be he that lieth with his father's wife; because he \nhath uncovered his father's skirt. And all the people shall say: Amen. {S}\n","Cursed be he that lieth with any manner of beast. And all the people shall say: Amen. {S}\n","Cursed be he that lieth with his sister, the daughter of his \nfather, or the daughter of his mother. And all the people shall say: \nAmen. {S}\n","Cursed be he that lieth with his mother-in-law. And all the people shall say: Amen. {S}\n","Cursed be he that smiteth his neighbour in secret. And all the people shall say: Amen. {S}\n","Cursed be he that taketh a bribe to slay an innocent person. And all the people shall say: Amen. {S}\n","Cursed be he that confirmeth not the words of this law to do them. And all the people shall say: Amen.' {P}\n"]
