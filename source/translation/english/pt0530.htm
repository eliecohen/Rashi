["And it shall come to pass, when all these things are come upon \nthee, the blessing and the curse, which I have set before thee, and thou\n shalt bethink thyself among all the nations, whither the LORD thy God \nhath driven thee,\n","and shalt return unto the LORD thy God, and hearken to His \nvoice according to all that I command thee this day, thou and thy \nchildren, with all thy heart, and with all thy soul;\n","that then the LORD thy God will turn thy captivity, and have \ncompassion upon thee, and will return and gather thee from all the \npeoples, whither the LORD thy God hath scattered thee.\n","If any of thine that are dispersed be in the uttermost parts of\n heaven, from thence will the LORD thy God gather thee, and from thence \nwill He fetch thee.\n","And the LORD thy God will bring thee into the land which thy \nfathers possessed, and thou shalt possess it; and He will do thee good, \nand multiply thee above thy fathers.\n","And the LORD thy God will circumcise thy heart, and the heart \nof thy seed, to love the LORD thy God with all thy heart, and with all \nthy soul, that thou mayest live.\n","And the LORD thy God will put all these curses upon thine enemies, and on them that hate thee, that persecuted thee.\n","And thou shalt return and hearken to the voice of the LORD, and do all His commandments which I command thee this day.\n","And the LORD thy God will make thee over-abundant in all the \nwork of thy hand, in the fruit of thy body, and in the fruit of thy \ncattle, and in the fruit of thy land, for good; for the LORD will again \nrejoice over thee for good, as He rejoiced over thy fathers;\n","if thou shalt hearken to the voice of the LORD thy God, to \nkeep His commandments and His statutes which are written in this book of\n the law; if thou turn unto the LORD thy God with all thy heart, and \nwith all thy soul. {S}\n","For this commandment which I command thee this day, it is not too hard for thee, neither is it far off.\n","It is not in heaven, that thou shouldest say: 'Who shall go up\n for us to heaven, and bring it unto us, and make us to hear it, that we\n may do it?'\n","Neither is it beyond the sea, that thou shouldest say: 'Who \nshall go over the sea for us, and bring it unto us, and make us to hear \nit, that we may do it?'\n","But the word is very nigh unto thee, in thy mouth, and in thy heart, that thou mayest do it. {S}\n","See, I have set before thee this day life and good, and death and evil,\n","in that I command thee this day to love the LORD thy God, to \nwalk in His ways, and to keep His commandments and His statutes and His \nordinances; then thou shalt live and multiply, and the LORD thy God \nshall bless thee in the land whither thou goest in to possess it.\n","But if thy heart turn away, and thou wilt not hear, but shalt be drawn away, and worship other gods, and serve them;\n","I declare unto you this day, that ye shall surely perish; ye \nshall not prolong your days upon the land, whither thou passest over the\n Jordan to go in to possess it.\n","I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day, that I\n have set before thee life and death, the blessing and the curse; \ntherefore choose life, that thou mayest live, thou and thy seed;\n","to love the LORD thy God, to hearken to His voice, and to \ncleave unto Him; for that is thy life, and the length of thy days; that \nthou mayest dwell in the land which the LORD swore unto thy fathers, to \nAbraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give them. {P}\n"]
