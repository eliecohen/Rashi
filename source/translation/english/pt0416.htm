["Now Korah, the son of Izhar, the son of Kohath, the son of \nLevi, with Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, and On, the son of \nPeleth, sons of Reuben, took men;\n","and they rose up in face of Moses, with certain of the children\n of Israel, two hundred and fifty men; they were princes of the \ncongregation, the elect men of the assembly, men of renown;\n","and they assembled themselves together against Moses and \nagainst Aaron, and said unto them: 'Ye take too much upon you, seeing \nall the congregation are holy, every one of them, and the LORD is among \nthem; wherefore then lift ye up yourselves above the assembly of the \nLORD?'\n","And when Moses heard it, he fell upon his face.\n","And he spoke unto Korah and unto all his company, saying: 'In \nthe morning the LORD will show who are His, and who is holy, and will \ncause him to come near unto Him; even him whom He may choose will He \ncause to come near unto Him.\n","This do: take you censors, Korah, and all his company;\n","and put fire therein, and put incense upon them before the LORD\n to-morrow; and it shall be that the man whom the LORD doth choose, he \nshall be holy; ye take too much upon you, ye sons of Levi.'\n","And Moses said unto Korah: 'Hear now, ye sons of Levi:\n","is it but a small thing unto you, that the God of Israel hath \nseparated you from the congregation of Israel, to bring you near to \nHimself, to do the service of the tabernacle of the LORD, and to stand \nbefore the congregation to minister unto them;\n","and that He hath brought thee near, and all thy brethren the sons of Levi with thee? and will ye seek the priesthood also?\n","Therefore thou and all thy company that are gathered together \nagainst the LORD--; and as to Aaron, what is he that ye murmur against \nhim?'\n","And Moses sent to call Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab; and they said: 'We will not come up;\n","is it a small thing that thou hast brought us up out of a land\n flowing with milk and honey, to kill us in the wilderness, but thou \nmust needs make thyself also a prince over us?\n","Moreover thou hast not brought us into a land flowing with \nmilk and honey, nor given us inheritance of fields and vineyards; wilt \nthou put out the eyes of these men? we will not come up.'\n","And Moses was very wroth, and said unto the LORD: 'Respect not\n Thou their offering; I have not taken one ass from them, neither have I\n hurt one of them.'\n","And Moses said unto Korah: 'Be thou and all thy congregation before the LORD, thou, and they, and Aaron, to-morrow;\n","and take ye every man his fire-pan, and put incense upon them,\n and bring ye before the LORD every man his fire-pan, two hundred and \nfifty fire-pans; thou also, and Aaron, each his fire-pan.'\n","And they took every man his fire-pan, and put fire in them, \nand laid incense thereon, and stood at the door of the tent of meeting \nwith Moses and Aaron.\n","And Korah assembled all the congregation against them unto the\n door of the tent of meeting; and the glory of the LORD appeared unto \nall the congregation. {S}\n","And the LORD spoke unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying:\n","'Separate yourselves from among this congregation, that I may consume them in a moment.'\n","And they fell upon their faces, and said: 'O God, the God of \nthe spirits of all flesh, shall one man sin, and wilt Thou be wroth with\n all the congregation?' {S}\n","And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying:\n","'Speak unto the congregation, saying: Get you up from about the dwelling of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram.'\n","And Moses rose up and went unto Dathan and Abiram; and the elders of Israel followed him.\n","And he spoke unto the congregation, saying: 'Depart, I pray \nyou, from the tents of these wicked men, and touch nothing of theirs, \nlest ye be swept away in all their sins.'\n","So they got them up from the dwelling of Korah, Dathan, and \nAbiram, on every side; and Dathan and Abiram came out, and stood at the \ndoor of their tents, with their wives, and their sons, and their little \nones.\n","And Moses said: 'Hereby ye shall know that the LORD hath sent \nme to do all these works, and that I have not done them of mine own \nmind.\n","If these men die the common death of all men, and be visited after the visitation of all men, then the LORD hath not sent Me.\n","But if the LORD make a new thing, and the ground open her \nmouth, and swallow them up, with all that appertain unto them, and they \ngo down alive into the pit, then ye shall understand that these men have\n despised the LORD.'\n","And it came to pass, as he made an end of speaking all these words, that the ground did cleave asunder that was under them.\n","And the earth opened her mouth and swallowed them up, and \ntheir households, and all the men that appertained unto Korah, and all \ntheir goods.\n","So they, and all that appertained to them, went down alive \ninto the pit; and the earth closed upon them, and they perished from \namong the assembly.\n","And all Israel that were round about them fled at the cry of them; for they said: 'Lest the earth swallow us up.'\n","And fire came forth from the LORD, and devoured the two hundred and fifty men that offered the incense. {S}\n"]
