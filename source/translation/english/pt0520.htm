["When thou goest forth to battle against thine enemies, and \nseest horses, and chariots, and a people more than thou, thou shalt not \nbe afraid of them; for the LORD thy God is with thee, who brought thee \nup out of the land of Egypt.\n","And it shall be, when ye draw nigh unto the battle, that the priest shall approach and speak unto the people,\n","and shall say unto them: 'Hear, O Israel, ye draw nigh this day\n unto battle against your enemies; let not your heart faint; fear not, \nnor be alarmed, neither be ye affrighted at them;\n","for the LORD your God is He that goeth with you, to fight for you against your enemies, to save you.'\n","And the officers shall speak unto the people, saying: 'What man\n is there that hath built a new house, and hath not dedicated it? let \nhim go and return to his house, lest he die in the battle, and another \nman dedicate it.\n","And what man is there that hath planted a vineyard, and hath \nnot used the fruit thereof? let him go and return unto his house, lest \nhe die in the battle, and another man use the fruit thereof.\n","And what man is there that hath betrothed a wife, and hath not \ntaken her? let him go and return unto his house, lest he die in the \nbattle, and another man take her.'\n","And the officers shall speak further unto the people, and they \nshall say: 'What man is there that is fearful and faint-hearted? let him\n go and return unto his house, lest his brethren's heart melt as his \nheart.'\n","And it shall be, when the officers have made an end of speaking\n unto the people, that captains of hosts shall be appointed at the head \nof the people. {S}\n","When thou drawest nigh unto a city to fight against it, then proclaim peace unto it.\n","And it shall be, if it make thee answer of peace, and open \nunto thee, then it shall be, that all the people that are found therein \nshall become tributary unto thee, and shall serve thee.\n","And if it will make no peace with thee, but will make war against thee, then thou shalt besiege it.\n","And when the LORD thy God delivereth it into thy hand, thou shalt smite every male thereof with the edge of the sword;\n","but the women, and the little ones, and the cattle, and all \nthat is in the city, even all the spoil thereof, shalt thou take for a \nprey unto thyself; and thou shalt eat the spoil of thine enemies, which \nthe LORD thy God hath given thee.\n","Thus shalt thou do unto all the cities which are very far off from thee, which are not of the cities of these nations.\n","Howbeit of the cities of these peoples, that the LORD thy God \ngiveth thee for an inheritance, thou shalt save alive nothing that \nbreatheth,\n","but thou shalt utterly destroy them: the Hittite, and the \nAmorite, the Canaanite, and the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite;\n as the LORD thy God hath commanded thee;\n","that they teach you not to do after all their abominations, \nwhich they have done unto their gods, and so ye sin against the LORD \nyour God. {S}\n","When thou shalt besiege a city a long time, in making war \nagainst it to take it, thou shalt not destroy the trees thereof by \nwielding an axe against them; for thou mayest eat of them, but thou \nshalt not cut them down; for is the tree of the field man, that it \nshould be besieged of thee?\n","Only the trees of which thou knowest that they are not trees \nfor food, them thou mayest destroy and cut down, that thou mayest build \nbulwarks against the city that maketh war with thee, until it fall. {P}\n"]
