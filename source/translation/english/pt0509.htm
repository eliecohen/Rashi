["Hear, O Israel: thou art to pass over the Jordan this day, to \ngo in to dispossess nations greater and mightier than thyself, cities \ngreat and fortified up to heaven,\n","a people great and tall, the sons of the Anakim, whom thou \nknowest, and of whom thou hast heard say: 'Who can stand before the sons\n of Anak?'\n","Know therefore this day, that the LORD thy God is He who goeth \nover before thee as a devouring fire; He will destroy them, and He will \nbring them down before thee; so shalt thou drive them out, and make them\n to perish quickly, as the LORD hath spoken unto thee.\n","Speak not thou in thy heart, after that the LORD thy God hath \nthrust them out from before thee, saying: 'For my righteousness the LORD\n hath brought me in to possess this land'; whereas for the wickedness of\n these nations the LORD doth drive them out from before thee.\n","Not for thy righteousness, or for the uprightness of thy heart,\n dost thou go in to possess their land; but for the wickedness of these \nnations the LORD thy God doth drive them out from before thee, and that \nHe may establish the word which the LORD swore unto thy fathers, to \nAbraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.\n","Know therefore that it is not for thy righteousness that the \nLORD thy God giveth thee this good land to possess it; for thou art a \nstiffnecked people.\n","Remember, forget thou not, how thou didst make the LORD thy God\n wroth in the wilderness; from the day that thou didst go forth out of \nthe land of Egypt, until ye came unto this place, ye have been \nrebellious against the LORD.\n","Also in Horeb ye made the LORD wroth, and the LORD was angered with you to have destroyed you.\n","When I was gone up into the mount to receive the tables of \nstone, even the tables of the covenant which the LORD made with you, \nthen I abode in the mount forty days and forty nights; I did neither eat\n bread nor drink water.\n","And the LORD delivered unto me the two tables of stone written\n with the finger of God; and on them was written according to all the \nwords, which the LORD spoke with you in the mount out of the midst of \nthe fire in the day of the assembly.\n","And it came to pass at the end of forty days and forty nights,\n that the LORD gave me the two tables of stone, even the tables of the \ncovenant.\n","And the LORD said unto me: 'Arise, get thee down quickly from \nhence; for thy people that thou hast brought forth out of Egypt have \ndealt corruptly; they are quickly turned aside out of the way which I \ncommanded them; they have made them a molten image.'\n","Furthermore the LORD spoke unto me, saying: 'I have seen this people, and, behold, it is a stiffnecked people;\n","let Me alone, that I may destroy them, and blot out their name\n from under heaven; and I will make of thee a nation mightier and \ngreater than they.'\n","So I turned and came down from the mount, and the mount burned\n with fire; and the two tables of the covenant were in my two hands.\n","And I looked, and, behold, ye had sinned against the LORD your\n God; ye had made you a molten calf; ye had turned aside quickly out of \nthe way which the LORD had commanded you.\n","And I took hold of the two tables, and cast them out of my two hands, and broke them before your eyes.\n","And I fell down before the LORD, as at the first, forty days \nand forty nights; I did neither eat bread nor drink water; because of \nall your sin which ye sinned, in doing that which was evil in the sight \nof the LORD, to provoke Him.\n","For I was in dread of the anger and hot displeasure, wherewith\n the LORD was wroth against you to destroy you. But the LORD hearkened \nunto me that time also.\n","Moreover the LORD was very angry with Aaron to have destroyed him; and I prayed for Aaron also the same time.\n","And I took your sin, the calf which ye had made, and burnt it \nwith fire, and beat it in pieces, grinding it very small, until it was \nas fine as dust; and I cast the dust thereof into the brook that \ndescended out of the mount.--\n","And at Taberah, and at Massah, and at Kibroth-hattaavah, ye made the LORD wroth.\n","And when the LORD sent you from Kadesh-barnea, saying: 'Go up \nand possess the land which I have given you'; then ye rebelled against \nthe commandment of the LORD your God, and ye believed Him not, nor \nhearkened to His voice.\n","Ye have been rebellious against the LORD from the day that I knew you.--\n","So I fell down before the LORD the forty days and forty nights\n that I fell down; because the LORD had said He would destroy you.\n","And I prayed unto the LORD, and said: 'O Lord GOD, destroy not\n Thy people and Thine inheritance, that Thou hast redeemed through Thy \ngreatness, that Thou hast brought forth out of Egypt with a mighty hand.\n","Remember Thy servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; look not \nunto the stubbornness of this people, nor to their wickedness, nor to \ntheir sin;\n","lest the land whence Thou broughtest us out say: Because the \nLORD was not able to bring them into the land which He promised unto \nthem, and because He hated them, He hath brought them out to slay them \nin the wilderness.\n","Yet they are Thy people and Thine inheritance, that Thou didst bring out by Thy great power and by Thy outstretched arm.' {P}\n"]
