["These are the words which Moses spoke unto all Israel beyond \nthe Jordan; in the wilderness, in the Arabah, over against Suph, between\n Paran and Tophel, and Laban, and Hazeroth, and Di-zahab.\n","It is eleven days journey from Horeb unto Kadesh-barnea by the way of mount Seir.\n","And it came to pass in the fortieth year, in the eleventh \nmonth, on the first day of the month, that Moses spoke unto the children\n of Israel, according unto all that the LORD had given him in \ncommandment unto them;\n","after he had smitten Sihon the king of the Amorites, who dwelt \nin Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, who dwelt in Ashtaroth, at Edrei;\n","beyond the Jordan, in the land of Moab, took Moses upon him to expound this law, saying:\n","The LORD our God spoke unto us in Horeb, saying: 'Ye have dwelt long enough in this mountain;\n","turn you, and take your journey, and go to the hill-country of \nthe Amorites and unto all the places nigh thereunto, in the Arabah, in \nthe hill-country, and in the Lowland, and in the South, and by the \nsea-shore; the land of the Canaanites, and Lebanon, as far as the great \nriver, the river Euphrates.\n","Behold, I have set the land before you: go in and possess the \nland which the LORD swore unto your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and \nto Jacob, to give unto them and to their seed after them.'\n","And I spoke unto you at that time, saying: 'I am not able to bear you myself alone;\n","the LORD your God hath multiplied you, and, behold, ye are this day as the stars of heaven for multitude.--\n","The LORD, the God of your fathers, make you a thousand times so many more as ye are, and bless you, as He hath promised you!--\n","How can I myself alone bear your cumbrance, and your burden, and your strife?\n","Get you, from each one of your tribes, wise men, and \nunderstanding, and full of knowledge, and I will make them heads over \nyou.'\n","And ye answered me, and said: 'The thing which thou hast spoken is good for us to do.'\n","So I took the heads of your tribes, wise men, and full of \nknowledge, and made them heads over you, captains of thousands, and \ncaptains of hundreds, and captains of fifties, and captains of tens, and\n officers, tribe by tribe.\n","And I charged your judges at that time, saying: 'Hear the \ncauses between your brethren, and judge righteously between a man and \nhis brother, and the stranger that is with him.\n","Ye shall not respect persons in judgment; ye shall hear the \nsmall and the great alike; ye shall not be afraid of the face of any \nman; for the judgment is God's; and the cause that is too hard for you \nye shall bring unto me, and I will hear it.'\n","And I commanded you at that time all the things which ye should do.\n","And we journeyed from Horeb, and went through all that great \nand dreadful wilderness which ye saw, by the way to the hill-country of \nthe Amorites, as the LORD our God commanded us; and we came to \nKadesh-barnea.\n","And I said unto you: 'Ye are come unto the hill-country of the Amorites, which the LORD our God giveth unto us.\n","Behold, the LORD thy God hath set the land before thee; go up,\n take possession, as the LORD, the God of thy fathers, hath spoken unto \nthee; fear not, neither be dismayed.'\n","And ye came near unto me every one of you, and said: 'Let us \nsend men before us, that they may search the land for us, and bring us \nback word of the way by which we must go up, and the cities unto which \nwe shall come.'\n","And the thing pleased me well; and I took twelve men of you, one man for every tribe;\n","and they turned and went up into the mountains, and came unto the valley of Eshcol, and spied it out.\n","And they took of the fruit of the land in their hands, and \nbrought it down unto us, and brought us back word, and said: 'Good is \nthe land which the LORD our God giveth unto us.'\n","Yet ye would not go up, but rebelled against the commandment of the LORD your God;\n","and ye murmured in your tents, and said: 'Because the LORD \nhated us, He hath brought us forth out of the land of Egypt, to deliver \nus into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us.\n","Whither are we going up? our brethren have made our heart to \nmelt, saying: The people is greater and taller than we; the cities are \ngreat and fortified up to heaven; and moreover we have seen the sons of \nthe Anakim there.'\n","Then I said unto you: 'Dread not, neither be afraid of them.\n","The LORD your God who goeth before you, He shall fight for you, according to all that He did for you in Egypt before your eyes;\n","and in the wilderness, where thou hast seen how that the LORD \nthy God bore thee, as a man doth bear his son, in all the way that ye \nwent, until ye came unto this place.\n","Yet in this thing ye do not believe the LORD your God,\n","Who went before you in the way, to seek you out a place to \npitch your tents in: in fire by night, to show you by what way ye should\n go, and in the cloud by day.'\n","And the LORD heard the voice of your words, and was wroth, and swore, saying:\n","'Surely there shall not one of these men, even this evil \ngeneration, see the good land, which I swore to give unto your fathers,\n","save Caleb the son of Jephunneh, he shall see it; and to him \nwill I give the land that he hath trodden upon, and to his children; \nbecause he hath wholly followed the LORD.'\n","Also the LORD was angry with me for your sakes, saying: Thou also shalt not go in thither;\n","Joshua the son of Nun, who standeth before thee, he shall go \nin thither; encourage thou him, for he shall cause Israel to inherit it.\n","Moreover your little ones, that ye said should be a prey, and \nyour children, that this day have no knowledge of good or evil, they \nshall go in thither, and unto them will I give it, and they shall \npossess it.\n","But as for you, turn you, and take your journey into the wilderness by the way to the Red Sea.'\n","Then ye answered and said unto me: 'We have sinned against the\n LORD, we will go up and fight, according to all that the LORD our God \ncommanded us.' And ye girded on every man his weapons of war, and deemed\n it a light thing to go up into the hill-country.\n","And the LORD said unto me: 'Say unto them: Go not up, neither \nfight; for I am not among you; lest ye be smitten before your enemies.'\n","So I spoke unto you, and ye hearkened not; but ye rebelled \nagainst the commandment of the LORD, and were presumptuous, and went up \ninto the hill-country.\n","And the Amorites, that dwell in that hill-country, came out \nagainst you, and chased you, as bees do, and beat you down in Seir, even\n unto Hormah.\n","And ye returned and wept before the LORD; but the LORD hearkened not to your voice, nor gave ear unto you.\n","So ye abode in Kadesh many days, according unto the days that ye abode there.\n"]
